A note on the "lack" of things in my GitHub


Hello,

As we all know there are academic integrity and academic honesty policies in every university setting. To comply by these policies all of my work that was prompted by a class (all of it as of now) is in my account in private repositories. I am able to open these files up for viewing in person during an interview or at an agreed specified time as long as I notify my professor in advanced. 

I appreciate the patience and would love to hear from you if you are curious to know what is locked behind these solid bars of confinement. (It's java projects, lots of learning java projects. with games)
